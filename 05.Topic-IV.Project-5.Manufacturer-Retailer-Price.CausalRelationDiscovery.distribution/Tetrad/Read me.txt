Steps to build causal graph in Tetrad

1. Use the "Data" box and load the residuals data that you saved in R.
2. Connect the "Data" box to the "Search" box. You will need 2 "Search" boxes, one to run PC algorithm and the other for LiNGAM algorithm.
3. Once you select the algorithm, the algorithm will output the causal graph.
