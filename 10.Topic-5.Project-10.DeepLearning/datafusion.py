# Name: Data Fusion Project
# Vers: 1.0
# author : Zachary Taylor (zctaylor@ncsu.edu)
# Description: In this project, we will have you
# implement the algorithm discussed in "paper citation"
# using Tensorflow to solve the issue of image classification. 
# In addition, we will also ask you to clean and filter the 
# training data to reduce training time. At the end of the 
# project, the following learning goals should be achieved:
#   1. How to take data of different modalities and combine
#       them to answer a question about the entire dataset
#   2. How to sample and reduce very large datasets to test
#       and validate your algorithm
